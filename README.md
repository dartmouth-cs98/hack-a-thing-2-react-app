# hack-a-thing-2-react-app
Created by Deven Orie and Joe Connolly

Below is a Short description of what we attempted to build.

Note: To run, download onto desktop, download NodeJS, and run the server on the file.

Joe and I built a ReactJS App. This web app allows a user to create a to-do list easily and categorize each task by a certain category classifier. This project makes API calls to a public JSON dataset, has delete and add functions to give the user full control over their structured to-do list and takes in user inputs allowing the user to easily change and create new tasks. 

I worked with Joe Connolly on this project. I have never worked with ReactJS before so the learning curve took a while. My skills in learning how Node(NPM) works, javascript, JSON and API calls improved from this project. I particularly enjoyed learning how to access public data from other websites and show it on the site that Joe and I developed. 

I had trouble with formatting the website the way I wanted. I struggled with this for quite some time because it was hard to find how the buttons and labels were bounded together and it was difficult to flexibly move these items around. 


This tutorial helped with developing the project and we followed its steps. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A71aqufiNtQ
