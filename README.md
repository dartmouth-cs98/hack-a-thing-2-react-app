# Project Manager Webapp 
#### By Deven Orie and Joe Connolly 

### Description:
The Project Manager webapp is a CRUD app for keeping track of a list of projects. The app has delete and add functions to give the user full control over their structured to-do list and takes in user inputs allowing the user to easily change and create new tasks. We developed the app as a frontend-only React.js app.  We also displayed JSON records from an external public API, to get practice with this functionality in React.js. Below is a screenshot of the finished product:

### Installation:
Clone the repository and navigate to its root folder. Install npm tools to compile and run React following the linked tutorials below.  Then you should simply be able to run the below comand and navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser to use the webapp.
```bash
npm start
```

### Who Did What:
I coded the main components and structures of the app following the linked React.js tutorial.  Deven then added on functionality by displaying a timestamp of when each project was submitted to the project list.  Deven also practiced calling an external API to display JSON data in the React.js front end (which is unrelated to the rest of the app - we just wanted to try out this feature of React).  I then followed CSS guide pages on W3 schools (linked in code) to make the UI easier to use.    

### What we learned:
To build the app we followed the React.js tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A71aqufiNtQ

I (Joe) had very limited experience with React.js and Deven had no experience with React.js.  We both also had only limited experience with other web development technologies - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was a good opportunity for us to learn the popular React.js frontend JavaScript framework, as well as further develop our skills in web development.

### Relation to Possible Project Ideas:
The majority of project ideas that looked promising to us require web applications as key components. Hence gaining experience in React.js, possibly the most popular front end JavaScript framework, could prove very useful for us when we implement our COSC 98 project. 

### What didn't work:
Deven had trouble formatting the website the way he wanted. He struggled with this for quite some time because it was hard to find how the buttons and labels were bounded together in React and it was difficult to flexibly move these items around.
